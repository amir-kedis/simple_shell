Amidst the quiet of the night's embrace,
Stars above, a soft and gentle grace.
Whispers of the wind, secrets it imparts,
Nature's song, it soothes our restless hearts.

In the dawn's first light, a world anew,
Colors paint the sky in vibrant hue.
Life's journey, an adventure to explore,
In every step, there's something to adore.

So let us cherish moments, big and small,
For life's a precious gift, a wondrous thrall.
With every sunrise, a chance to start anew,
In this vast world, there's endless beauty to pursue.w
